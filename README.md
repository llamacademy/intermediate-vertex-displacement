# Waves in ShaderGraph (URP)

In this tutorial repository and [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/poi10W6LHJo) you will learn how to create 2 types of waves - linear and radial/circular waves in ShaderGraph with Maths!

The most common application for waves is water or liquids, but you can apply these throughout your game or integrate them with other shaders to get cool effects, like Wind.

This tutorial uses math from [Nvidia's GPU Gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-vi-beyond-triangles/chapter-42-deformers)
